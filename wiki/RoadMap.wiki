== First release ==

* Documentation improvements. Especially
* More non-trivial examples
* MOS model 
* Stability analysis, root-locus, 

== Later ==

* New analyses
  * Mixed frequency/time-domain analysis (QPSS)
  * Harmonic-balance
* Numerical reduction of symbolic expression
* Determinant Decision Diagram (DDD) 
* Symbolic distortion analysis
* Support for Verilog-A(MS) like constructs like ddt, idt, cross
* Transient: roll-back capability, discarding of time steps
* Co-simulation with myHDL
* Geometric programming optimization and constraints generation from circuit description.
* Implicit expressions for i,q, etc. in hdl.py, solve equations, perhaps numerically
   * maybe we can use the newton solver to solve the implicit equations by adding nodes
* Switch expressions
* EM-solver
* Convolution based transient analysis of circuits defined in the frequency domain 
* State-space based analyses
