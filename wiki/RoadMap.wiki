== Public announcement ==

  * Documentation improvements
    * More non-trivial examples
  * MOS model 

== First release ==

=== pycircuit.sim ===

  * Stability analysis: root-locus


== Later ==

=== pycircuit.sim ===
  * Spectre support

=== pycircuit.post ===
  * HDF5 storage of results
  * waveform vector quantities (can be used to handle busses etc)
  * digital signal waveforms

=== pycircuit.circuit ===
  * New analyses
    * Mixed frequency/time-domain analysis (QPSS)
    * Harmonic-balance
  * Numerical reduction of symbolic expression
  * Determinant Decision Diagram (DDD) 
  * Symbolic distortion analysis
  * Support for Verilog-A(MS) like constructs like ddt, idt, cross
  * Transient: roll-back capability, discarding of time steps
  * Co-simulation with myHDL
  * Geometric programming optimization and constraints generation from circuit description.
  * Implicit expressions for i,q, etc. in hdl.py, solve equations, perhaps numerically
     * maybe we can use the newton solver to solve the implicit equations by adding nodes
  * Switch expressions
  * EM-solver
  * Convolution based transient analysis of circuits defined in the frequency domain 
  * State-space based analyses

= Higher level tool ideas =
  * Create a netlister for pycircuit.circuit for gschem in the GEDA project
  * Waveform viewer, could use other projects for this like [http://code.google.com/python-siva python-siva] which will use Chaco and Enthought Traits for this
  * A specification driven verification suite where you can develop unit tests your circuits
  * A schematic editor written in Python
